                        Due to regulations by the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) and other signatories,
                        speeds are required to be reduced between the Earth and the Moon. As such, it takes aproximately
                        3 to 4 hours.

                        Mars is the last stopping point for mining ships heading into the main asteroid belt,
                        as well as a midpoint for mining drones making the long trip to the Kuiper Belt.
                        While Titan is planned to take on most of the drone traffic in the coming decades,
                        for now the space around Mars is rather crowded. As such, plan on 8-12 hours of travel.

                        Yes! While certain areas of Mars are off limits, the heavy industry and pollution is
                        intentional.
                        As we continue to clean up our planet from the disasters of the 21st century, the UNC (United
                        Nations Coalition)
                        as well as the few nation-states remaining have agreed to transfer all Co2 producing industries
                        off world to Mars. What is bad for Earth is great for Mars, as over time the excess Co2 will
                        help
                        in our terraforming project. But Unity is well protected with multiple failsafes, as are your
                        complimentary envirosuits.

                        Thankfully, as of last year SOLIT upgraded our entire fleet to the new S-848. Not only is it
                        faster
                        than the S-800, all passenger cabins have a low-level gravity (slightly less than the Moons) as
                        well
                        as magboots. For those who still struggle with the reduced gravity we do still offer the

                        Aproximate travel time to Europa is 2 days, while Titan is an estimated 3 days. Thankfully,
                        once past the main asteroid belt the S-848 is able to run its sub-hyper drive at 100% power.
                        This allows us to shorten your trip there and back from what just a few decades ago took weeks!

                        Yes! The UNC has granted SOLIT rights to a hotel on Neptune's upcoming Cecilia Payne
                        Observatory.
                        The science quarters are expected to be completed within five years, with the station being
                        fully
                        completed within the next ten years. This center will be used to launch probes past the Kuiper
                        Belt
                        to detect and study nearby star systems in our quest to one day travel outside of our solar
                        system. Civilian
                        travel to Neptune should commence in the next fiften years as we await the final testing and UNC
                        approval of the SOLIT S-900.

                        The S-900's hyperdrive has shown great promise in coming extremely close to achieving
                        lightspeed.
                        At this time we are unable to share more as this is a joint-venture with the UNCN, but we can
                        share
                        that the human trials have shown promise and that most test subjects have shown little to no
                        physical effects from traveling at such high speeds.

                        As our understanding of quantum physics grows, we're learning that
                        there are ways to travel faster than the speed of light. Of course, "faster than the speed of light" is an incredibly 
                        incorrect way to put it,
                        but the physics of "FTL" drives is rather difficult! We now know that "FTL" travel is possible in
                        theory,
                        but currently lack the ability to generate the amount of energy needed to even test the theory.
                        We are hoping
                        that this next century is as productive or more than the last century.

                        It depends on the scope and what you're looking for. Currently,
                        I work with small portfolio sites and design, but am
                        willing to jump onto larger projects. Overall, it can take a
