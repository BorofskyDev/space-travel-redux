            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">Due to regulations by the UNSC (United Nations Space Command) and
                other signatories, speeds are required to be reduced
                between the Earth and the Moon. As such, it takes approximately 3 to 4 hours.</div>

            <div class="accordion-title fs-700 uppercase"><span>Travel time to mars</span></div>
            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">Mars is the last stopping point for mining ships heading into the main
                asteroid belt, as well as a midpoint for mining drones making the long trip to the Kuiper Belt.
                While Titan is planned to take on most of the drone traffic in the coming decades,
                for now the space around Mars is rather crowded. As such, plan on 8-12 hours of travel.</div>

            </div>
            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">While certain areas of Mars are off limits, the heavy industry and
                pollution is intentional. As we continue to clean up our planet from the disasters of the 21st century,
                the UNC (United
                Nations Coalition) as well as the few nation-states remaining have agreed to transfer all Co2 producing
                industries
                off world to Mars. What is bad for Earth is great for Mars, as over time the excess Co2 will
                help in our terraforming project. But Unity is well protected with multiple fail safes, as are your
                complimentary enviro-suits.

            <div class="accordion-title fs-700 uppercase"><span>Zero Gravity Travel</span></div>
            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">Thankfully, as of last year
                <span class="gradient-text active fs-500 letter-spacing-1 uppercase">solit</span>
                upgraded our entire fleet to the new S-848.
                Not only is it faster than the S-800, all passenger cabins have a low-level gravity (slightly less than
                the Moons) as
                well as magboots. For those who still struggle with the reduced gravity we do still offer the
                complimentary SOLIT Enhanced THC supplements to help with nausea and to provide an overall wonderful
                experience.

            <div class="accordion-title fs-700 uppercase"><span>Travel Time to Europa/Titan</span></div>
            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">Approximate travel time to Europa is 2 days, while Titan is an
                estimated 4 days. Thankfully,
                once past the main asteroid belt the S-848 is able to run its sub-hyper drive at 100% power.
                This allows us to shorten your trip there and back from what just a few decades ago took weeks!</div>

            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">The S-900's hyperdrive has shown great promise in coming extremely
                close to achieving
                lightspeed. At this time we are unable to share more as this is a joint-venture with the UNCN, but we
                can
                share that the human trials have shown promise and that most test subjects have shown little to no
                physical effects from traveling at such high speeds.</div>

            <div class="accordion-content fs-400">As our understanding of quantum physics and mechanics grows, we're
                learning that
                there are ways to travel faster than the speed of light. Of course, "faster than the speed of light" is
                an incredibly
                incorrect way to put it, but the physics of "FTL" drives is rather difficult! We now know that "FTL"
                travel is possible in
                theory, but currently lack the ability to generate the amount of energy needed to even test the theory.
                We are hoping that this next century is as productive or more than the last century.</div>
